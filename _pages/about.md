I am a 6th year graduate student in the Department of Physics at The George Washington University (GWU). My research is in the field of time domain and transient astrophysics. In particular, I am interested in the formation and evolution of high energy transients and their progenitors. I use a variety of optical, infrared, and X-ray observatories to study gamma-ray bursts, kilonovae, compact objects, X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, fast radio bursts, and gravitational wave sources across the electromagnetic spectrum.

**Here is an image of [M51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy) that I obtained using the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) mounted on the 4-m Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT). The galaxy happened to be in the field of view of GRB 220408A:**
