I am a 6th year graduate student in the Department of Physics at The George Washington University (GWU). My research is in the field of time domain and transient astrophysics. In particular, I am interested in the formation and evolution of high energy transients and their progenitors. Below I outline a few research interests and highlights.

Extragalactic Astronomy
======

Short Gamma-ray Bursts 
------

I have been involved in the study of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and their environments since January 2018, when I began working with [Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou](https://physics.columbian.gwu.edu/chryssa-kouveliotou) and [Dr. Paz Beniamini](https://pazbeniamini.wixsite.com/pazbeniamini) in my second semester at GWU. Our initial work focused on the [early X-ray lightcurves](https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/) of short GRBs, and the relation between the X-ray afterglow peak and the density of the environment surrounding the compact binary merger site. We identified that sGRBs occured in denser environments than previously understood [(O'Connor et al. 2020)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/495/4/4782/5846046), and that only a small minority of events could have merged outside of a host galaxy.

In June 2019, I began working with [Dr. Eleonora Troja](https://eleonoratroja.wordpress.com/), [Dr. Brad Cenko](https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Brad.Cenko/Brad_Cenkos_NASA_HomePage/Home.html), and [Dr. Simone Dichiara](https://science.psu.edu/astro/people/sbd5667) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). At this point, my study of sGRBs evolved, and my focus turned towards observational astronomy. In particular, I began studying the host galaxy environments of sGRBs using deep ground- and space-based imaging and spectroscopy from the [4-m Lowell Discovery Telescope](https://lowell.edu/research/telescopes-and-facilities/ldt/), the 8-m Gemini North and South Telescopes, the Keck Observatory, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This led to the publication of a catalog of sGRB host galaxies [(O'Connor et al. 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09059), including a significant fraction (~30%) without a conclusive host galaxy association. These events are labeled "hostless", and deep optical and infrared observations are required to discern whether these GRBs occured within a faint high redshift galaxy or truly originated outside the confines of a galaxy and within the intergalactic medium. In the future, I plan to use the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to set stronger constraints on "hostless" sGRBs.

Kilonovae
------

In addition to the environments of sGRBs, I am interested in the production of r-process elements emanating from the merger of binary neutron stars (BNS). The decay of these r-process elements leads to a radioactively powered transient, known as a kilonova or macronova. Kilonovae represent the conclusive electromagnetic signature of a BNS merger, and remain a primary focus of modern astrophysics. I will be involved in follow-up of the electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves (GWs) from NS-NS and NS-BH mergers in the [LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA O4 Observing Run](https://observing.docs.ligo.org/plan/#timeline) with the goal of identifying these elusive transients.

A sample of my previous work related to kilonovae can be found here: <br>

Fast Radio Bursts 
------

I am also interested in the progenitors of fast radio bursts (FRBs). The environment and formation channels of FRB-emitting sources remains an open question, and a source of great interest. I was involved in the study of the host galaxy and environment of [FRB 20201124A](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/12/aa41903-21/aa41903-21.html). We identified that the persistent radio source, which was localized to the viscinity of the FRB, was related to star formation in the host galaxy, as opposed to the FRB progenitor (e.g., FRB 20121102A/FRB 20190520B).

**Localization of FRB 20201124A to a star-forming region of its host galaxy using Chandra and the VLA (see [Piro et al. 2021](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/12/aa41903-21/aa41903-21.html)):**

Galactic Astronomy

The Swift Deep Galactic Plane Survey
------

In addition to my study of extragalactic sources, I am a member (since September 2019) of the Swift Deep Galactic Plane Survey (DGPS; PI: Chryssa Kouveliotou) which is conducting a systematic survey of the Galactic Plane to search for X-ray transients. Phase-I, covering 40 sq. deg. of the Galactic Plane, is now complete. The Survey is focused on identifying a variety of sources, including low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), cataclysmic variables (CVs), and magnetars. I recently led the study of a Be X-ray binary (BeXRB) identified through the DGPS [(O'Connor et al. 2022)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac5032). I have also been involved in follow-up of new magnetars [(Enoto et al. 2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac2665) and CVs [(Gorgone et al. 2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac2738). Current work is underway to classify a number of other transient sources discovered through the Survey (O'Connor et al., in preparation), including a newly identified polar magnetic CV (mCV). A catalog of sources discovered in Phase-I observations is also in preparation (O'Connor et al., in preparation).
