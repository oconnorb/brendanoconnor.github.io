I am a 6th year graduate student in the Department of Physics at The George Washington University (GWU). My research is in the field of time domain and transient astrophysics. In particular, I am interested in the formation and evolution of high energy transients and their progenitors.

Extragalactic Astronomy
======

Short Gamma-ray Bursts 
------

I have been involved in the study of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and their environments since January 2018, when I began working with [Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou](https://physics.columbian.gwu.edu/chryssa-kouveliotou) and [Dr. Paz Beniamini](https://pazbeniamini.wixsite.com/pazbeniamini) in my second semester at GWU. Our work focused on the early X-ray lightcurves of short GRBs, and the relation between the X-ray afterglow peak and the density of the environment surrounding the merger site. We identified that sGRBs occured in denser environments than previously thought [(O'Connor et al. 2020)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/495/4/4782/5846046).

In June 2019, I began working with [Dr. Eleonora Troja](https://eleonoratroja.wordpress.com/) and [Dr. Brad Cenko](https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Brad.Cenko/Brad_Cenkos_NASA_HomePage/Home.html) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). At this point, my study of sGRBs evolved, and the focus turned towards observational astronomy. In particular, I focused on the host galaxy environments of sGRBs using deep ground- and space-based imaging from the [4-m Lowell Discovery Telescope](https://lowell.edu/research/telescopes-and-facilities/ldt/), the 8-m Gemini North and South Telescopes, the Keck Observatory, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). 

Kilonovae
------

In addition to the environments of sGRBs, I am interested in the production of r-process elements emanating from the merger of binary neutron stars (BNS). The decay of these r-process elements leads to a radioactively powered transient, known as a kilonova or macronova. Kilonovae represent the conclusive electromagnetic signature of a BNS merger, and remain a primary focus of modern astrophysics. I will be involved in follow-up of the electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers (e.g. short gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae) in the LIGO O4 Observing Run with the goal of identifying these elusive transients.

A sample of my previous work on kilonovae can be found here: <br>

Fast Radio Bursts 
------

I am also interested in the progenitors of fast radio bursts (FRBs). The environment and formation channels of FRB-emitting sources remains an open question, and a source of great interest. I was involved in the study of the host galaxy and environment of [FRB 20201124A](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/12/aa41903-21/aa41903-21.html). We identified that the persistent radio source, which was localized to the viscinity of the FRB, was related to star formation in the host galaxy, as opposed to the FRB progenitor (e.g., FRB 20121102A andâ€‰FRB 20190520B).

Galactic Astronomy
======

The Swift Deep Galactic Plane Survey
------

In addition to my study of extragalactic sources, I am a lead member of the Swift Deep Galactic Plane Survey (DGPS; PI: Chryssa Kouveliotou) which is conducting a systematic survey of 40 sq. deg of the Galactic Plane to search for X-ray transients. The survey is focused on identifying a variety of sources, including high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), cataclysmic variables (CVs), and magnetars. I recently led the study of a Be X-ray binary (BeXRB) identified through the survey [(O'Connor et al. 2022)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac5032), and current work is focused on the identification of a number of other transient sources.
